Task 1:
    1. Static binding happens at compile-time while dynamic binding happens at runtime.
    In static binding the function definition and function call are linked during the compile-time,
    while in dynamic binding the function calls are not resolved until runtime, because
    in contrast to static binding compiler does not have enough information for a function call.
    General example of static binding is when we have a function defined in a class, an object
    of this class created and function being called. While a typical example of dynamic binding
    is an overrided virtual function by class B that inherits class A.
    2. Abstraction, Hierarchy
    3. It would, because circle is a subclass of an ellipse.
    4. Abstract class is a class that has at least one abstract(e.g. virtual) member function.
    5.Whenever a class defines a virtual function (or method), most compilers add a hidden member
    variable to the class that points to an array of pointers to (virtual) functions called the virtual method table.
    These pointers are used at runtime to invoke the appropriate function implementations, because at compile time
    it may not yet be known if the base function is to be called or a derived one implemented by a class that inherits
    from the base class.
    6. As opposed to referencing a data value, a function pointer points to executable code within memory.
    Invocation of it is also known as an "indirect" call, because the function is being invoked indirectly
    through a variable instead of directly through a fixed identifier or address.
    7. Virtual destructor is useful when you are trying to delete the derrived class, since
    In most implementations, the call to the destructor will be resolved like any non-virtual code,
    meaning that the destructor of the base class will be called but not the one of the derived class,
    resulting in a resources leak.

Task 2:
    1. Since "value" method is not virtual, it cannot be overrided, so the "value" from the Base class is being called.
    2. ???? No virtual methods has been found
